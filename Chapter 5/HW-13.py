"""
When an object is falling because of gravity, the following formula can be used to determine the distance the object falls in a specific time period:
d=1/2g * t**2
The variables in the formula are as follows: 
	d is the distance in meters
	g is 9.8
	t is the amount of time, in seconds, that the object has been falling.
Write a function named falling_distance that accepts an objectâ€™s falling time (in seconds) as an argument. The function should return the distance, in meters, that the object has fallen during that time interval. Write a program that calls the function in a loop that passes the values 1 through 10 as arguments and displays the return value.

GRAVITY = 9.8


def falling_distance(time):
    distance = (.5 * GRAVITY) * time**2
    return distance


def main():
    for i in range(1, 11):
        print(i, "seconds :", falling_distance(i), "meters")


main()
